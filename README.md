Piphys is available as a preprint on bioarXiv: 

[Light-weight electrophysiology hardware and software platform for cloud-based neural recording experiments](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.444685v2)

--------
## Overview

Piphys is an inexpensive open source neurophysiological recording platform based on Raspberry Pi. It is easily accessed and controlled via a standard web interface through Internet of Things (IoT) protocols. 

Piphys modules can be used in a fleet to enable long-term observations of neural development, organization, and activity at scale. 

## Design Files
